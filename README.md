# Data Compression using Python

This is a simple Python program for data compression.

## Introduction

This program uses the Huffman coding technique to compress data. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique. The algorithm works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, where the code words are shorter for the characters that occur more frequently in the input string.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

- Python 3.11

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository using the following command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/Nikhileshwar23/video-compression-system
    

2. Go to the project directory:
   
    
    cd data-compression-python
    

3. Run the program:
    
    python example_video_compression.py
    

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to compress or decompress data.

## Usage

This program can be used to compress data such as videos(.mp4 files).

1. Compressing Data

    To compress data, select the "Compress" option from the main menu. Enter the path of the file you want to compress, and the program will compress the data and save it to a new file with the ".huf" extension.

2. Decompressing Data

    To decompress data, select the "Decompress" option from the main menu. Enter the path of the compressed file (with the ".huf" extension), and the program will decompress the data and save it to a new file with the ".txt" extension.
