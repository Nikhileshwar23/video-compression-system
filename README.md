# Data Compression using Python

This is a simple Python program for data compression.

## Introduction

This program uses the Huffman coding technique to compress data. Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique. The algorithm works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, where the code words are shorter for the characters that occur more frequently in the input string.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need the following:

- Python 3.11

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository using the following command:

    
    git clone https://github.com/Nikhileshwar23/video-compression-system
    

2. Go to the project directory:
   
    
    cd data-compression-python
    

3. Run the program:
    
    python example_video_compression.py
    

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to compress data.

## Usage

This program can be used to compress data such as videos(.mp4 files).

1. Compressing Data

To compress data, Run the python code. Enter the path of the file you want to compress in the example_video_compression.py code as an input, and the program will compress the data and save the file as pos_video.mp4 in the new folder as compressed_video.
